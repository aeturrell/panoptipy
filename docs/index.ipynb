    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "The main way to use **panoptipy** is through its command-line interface. Here's how to scan a Python codebase that is in the \"project\" directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Basic scan with default settings\n",
    "$ panoptipy scan /path/to/project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run on multiple directories, you can specify them as a space-separated list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Scan multiple directories\n",
    "$ panoptipy scan /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use wildcards to specify directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Scan all directories in the current directory\n",
    "$ panoptipy scan ./*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `scan` command in this way will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load *all* configured checks (there's a list below)\n",
    "- Analyse your codebase\n",
    "- Generate a report with the results\n",
    "- Output the report to the console (by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "The scan report shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall codebase rating (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or Problematic)\n",
    "- A summary of whether each individual check passed or not\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a lot of overlap between **panoptipy** and **pre-commit** (with the relevant hooks). So what are the differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pre-commit** is meant to be used by developers to check their own code before they commit it or in Continuous Integration (CI) / Continous Deployment (CD) pipelines.\n",
    "- **panoptipy** has features that help the leaders and managers of other developers. To that end it can summarise the results of many code repos at once, eg:\n",
    "  - all those written by a (GitHub) team\n",
    "  - all those by a specific (GitHub) user\n",
    "- **panoptipy** can be be used to generate and export reports in a variety of formats (JSON, parquet) for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages are similar in that they can both be used in CI/CD pipelines but **pre-commit** should be your first port of call for that and is not only more geared to that use, but also *far* more mature."

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "```\n",
